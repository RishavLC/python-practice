# 1) define data type . what are the built in data types in python? describe each with example
# n = 3
# print(n)
# complexno
# a = 2+2j
# print(type(a)) 
# name = "Rishav"
# print(name)
# list = [1,2,3,4,5]
# print(type(list))
# x = {"name" : "Rishav", "age" : 21}
# print(x["age"])
# set
# sets = {1,2,3,4,5}
# don't use {} it does not create empty sets
# print(type(sets))
# sets = set()
# print(type(sets) ,sets)
# NoneType = None
# print(type(NoneType))
